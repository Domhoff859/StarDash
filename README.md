This is an unoffical continuation of this [Repository.](https://github.com/jesserichterklug/closed-symmetry-loop)

It uses the closed-symmetrie-loop in [Citation](#Citation) as a basis and rewrites the dataloader, star and dash representation to work without tensorflow or pytorch.

### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the problems that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based pose estimators have with symmetric objects. We consider the value of the CNNâ€™s output representation when continuously rotating the object and find that it has to form a closed loop after each step of symmetry. Otherwise, the CNN (which is itself a continuous function) has to replicate an uncontinuous function. On a 1-DOF toy example, we show that commonly used representations do not fulfill this demand and analyze the problems caused thereby. In particular, we find that the popular min-over-symmetries approach for creating a symmetry-aware loss tends not to work well with gradient-based optimization, i.e., deep learning. We propose a representation called "closed symmetry loop" (csl) from these insights, where the angle of relevant vectors is multiplied by the symmetry order and then generalize it to 6-DOF. The representation extends our algorithm from [1] including a method to disambiguate symmetric equivalents during the final pose estimation. The algorithm handles continuous rotational symmetry (e.g., a bottle) and discrete rotational symmetry (e.g., a 4-fold symmetric box). It is evaluated on the T-LESS dataset, where it reaches state-of-the-art for unrefining RGB-based methods.guate symmetric equivalents during the final pose estimation.
